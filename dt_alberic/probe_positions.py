def probe_positions(probe_distribution, geometry_params):
    '''
    Function that returns the list of np arrays with probe position coordinate pairs for a given distribution.
    Distributions implemented:
    'rabault151' - Original distribution of 151 used by Rabault in his two first papers
    'rabault241' - Similar distribution to 'Rabault151' but with a increased number of probes in the wake
    'rabault9' - Partial information distribution tested by Rabault in the appendix of his first 2019 paper.
    'base' - Distribution where n_base evenly distributed probes are only located at the base of the cylinder

    In addition, probes close to the jets can also be enabled by the boolean probes_at_jets. Note that these
    probes are redundant in the case with 151 so this argument will be ignored in that case

    :param probe_distribution: String that identifies a given distribution
    :param probes_at_jets: boolean - whether to use probes close to jets or not
    :param geometry_params
